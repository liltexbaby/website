            <h1>I'm a lot of things, but the most important thing is that I'm a fast learner.</h1>
            <p>I was born in Texas, but now I do my business in Brooklyn, NY. I like painting, web design, motion graphics, and making music, or really making anything at all. I'm probably watching a youtube tutorial as you read this, trying to add another item to that list. I've got a passion for high quality, well thought out work, and I'll do whatever it takes to get my vision across, no matter how many google searches it takes.</p>
